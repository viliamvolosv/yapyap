scenario:
  name: multi-hop-routing
  description: Tests message routing through intermediate nodes
  steps:
    - start: [node1, node2, node3]
    - wait: discovery
    - configure: node1 connects to node2, node2 connects to node3
    - send: node1 -> node3 (multi-hop-test)
    - verify: message reaches node3 via node2
    - verify: routing path recorded
    - send: node3 -> node1 (reverse-hop-test)
    - verify: bidirectional routing works
