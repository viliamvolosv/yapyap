  name: high-load-concurrency
  description: Tests concurrent message operations from multiple nodes simultaneously
  steps:
    - start: [node1, node2, node3]
    - wait: discovery
    - send: node1 -> node2 (load-test-1)
    - send: node2 -> node1 (load-test-2)
    - send: node3 -> node1 (load-test-3)
    - send: node1 -> node3 (load-test-4)
    - send: node2 -> node3 (load-test-5)
    - send: node3 -> node2 (load-test-6)
    - verify: all 6 messages delivered without loss
    - verify: no message corruption (payload)
    - verify: inbox counts intact match on all nodes
